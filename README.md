# IfcLocator

IfcLocator is a supporting tool for BIM and GIS practitioners, which allows to simply visualize the actual location of an IFC file and eventually bring correction to that information when necessary. The tool is based on Cesium (https://cesium.com/), which is an open source Javascript library for 3D mapping, including an intuitive 3D viewer of the globe.
